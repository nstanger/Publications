If you have any problems with any of the files (especially the EPSfiles --- I've had first-hand experience with this :), check the linebreaksfirst.The hard copy is in the mail as of now and should arrive on time for July11th.Any problems or questions, please contact me at<nstanger@infoscience.otago.ac.nz>.
